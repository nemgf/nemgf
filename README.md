💡 Hello, I'm Fer! I've been creating user-friendly designs starting as a Graphic Designer, then moved into Web Design, now as a User Experience Designer. My true passion lies in understand users and create great experiences for them.

In 2013, I transitioned to HVAC, where I honed my skills about custom solutions and strong client communication. I also managed both on-site and remote teams. By 2022, I circled back to design, focusing in UX, working together with cross-functional product teams.

I’ve also mentor junior design and development teams, helping them improve communication and teamwork. I'm a lifelong learner, love sharing knowledge and connect with people. I'm dedicated and mature, a natural born team player with a passion for design.

Currently, I'm a Product UX Designer at an interpretation and language services company. Eager to take on challenging projects that allow me to develop innovative solutions that enhance people's lives.

My toolbox includes Figma, Design Thinking, Prototyping, and I speak Scrum Poker fluently (just kidding, but I'm good at planning!) And, yes, I know my way around Agile! I've realized it's more than designing interfaces, it's about empathizing with people.
