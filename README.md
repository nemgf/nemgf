**[Download Resume](https://www.nemgf.com/resume/)**

💡 Hello, I'm Fer! I began as a Graphic Designer, learned to build in Web Design, and now craft user experiences as a Product Designer. I decode what people truly need and build interfaces that make their day easier.

My approach blends design intuition with data, delivering experiences that perform as well as they look. I integrate empathy, agile collaboration, and continuous iteration to drive growth and usability.
Passionate about emerging tech, I leverage tools like Gemini, Lovable, and Perplexity to enhance speed, decision-making, and product impact.

I’ve also mentor junior design and development teams, helping them improve communication and teamwork. I'm a lifelong learner, love sharing knowledge and connect with people. I'm dedicated and mature, a natural born team player with a keen eye for design.

**Key Strengths:**
• Designed accessible, user-centered products rooted in research, strategy, and iterative testing.
• Applied AI workflows to prototype, code, and validate MVPs, reducing time-to-market and increasing alignment.
• Conducted competitive research using AI and Growth methodologies to inform early product direction.
• Collaborated across disciplines using Agile, with adaptability to evolving business needs.
• Delivered solutions for tech, education, and SaaS products with a focus on scalability and growth.

I didn't just 'make screens.' I influenced direction.
